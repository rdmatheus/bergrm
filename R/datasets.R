#' @title Bird abundance in grazing areas
#'
#' @description The density of understorey birds at a
#' series of sites in two areas either side of a stockproof
#' fence.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 62 observations on the following 3 variables.
#'
#' \itemize{
#' \item \code{birds}: the number of understorey birds; a numeric vector.
#' \item \code{when}: when the bird count was conducted; a factor with levels \code{Before} (before herbivores were removed) and \code{After} (after herbivores were removed).
#' \item \code{grazed}: which side of the stockproof fence; a factor with levels \code{Reference} (grazed by native herbivores) and \code{Feral} (grazed by feral herbivores, mainly horses).

#' @details In this experiment, the density of understorey birds at
#' a series of sites in two areas either side of a stockproof fence
#' were compared. Once side had limited grazing (mainly from native
#' herbivores), and the other was heavily grazed by feral herbivores,
#' mostly horses. Bird counts were done at the sites either side of
#' the fence (the Before measurements). Then the herbivores were
#' removed, and bird counts done again (the After measurements).
#' The measurements are the total number of understorey-foraging
#' birds observed in three 20-minute surveys of two hectare quadrats.
