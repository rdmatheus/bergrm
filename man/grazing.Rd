\title{Bird abundance in grazing areas}
\format{
A data frame with 62 observations on the following 3 variables.

\itemize{
\item \code{birds}: the number of understorey birds; a numeric vector.
\item \code{when}: when the bird count was conducted; a factor with levels \code{Before} (before herbivores were removed) and \code{After} (after herbivores were removed).
\item \code{grazed}: which side of the stockproof fence; a factor with levels \code{Reference} (grazed by native herbivores) and \code{Feral} (grazed by feral herbivores, mainly horses).

\description{
The density of understorey birds at a
series of sites in two areas either side of a stockproof
fence.
}
\details{
In this experiment, the density of understorey birds at
a series of sites in two areas either side of a stockproof fence
were compared. Once side had limited grazing (mainly from native
herbivores), and the other was heavily grazed by feral herbivores,
mostly horses. Bird counts were done at the sites either side of
the fence (the Before measurements). Then the herbivores were
removed, and bird counts done again (the After measurements).
The measurements are the total number of understorey-foraging
birds observed in three 20-minute surveys of two hectare quadrats.
